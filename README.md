Library System
==============

I was given a task of creating a library system using OOP PHP and MySQL with a relational database. The system needed to follow a few guidelines in order for it to be fit for use at a school(hypothetically).

The Guidelines
==============
Staff members should be able to view newly added books 30 days before students could see them.
Each book should only be loaned out once at a time.
If a book was already loaned out then a user should be able to add it to a waiting list.
Only certain book types should be loaned out, the more expensive books should not be allowed such as reference books.


User Info
==============
As I haven't added a registration system to this I have added a couple of users to the database, one admin(staff) the other being a regular user(student).

Staff -
Username: Admin
Password: Password

Student -
Username: Regular
Password: Password
